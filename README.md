What is TypeScript? Why was it developed? 
-----------------------------------------
> A free & open-source programming Language that was created and maintained by Microsoft. It attempts to address / tackle the quirks and weirdness in the JavaScript (which was developed years ago). 

**Problems with JavaScript:**
- Typing: Lack of System (No type-checks) and no enforcement of typing
- Function arguments: When the number of arguments passed to a function is less, it assumes the missing arguments as 'undefined;. This default functionality, though it works fine, doesn't help much as the developers cannot work on 'undefined' elements. 
- Structure of Objects: How can the developers prevent others from adding new properties to an existing object? The loosely structured objects in JS is a big problem as there is no system in place to handle this issue.
- Application Complexity: Currently, the code bases has 1000s of 1000s of code. The applications are quite complex.
